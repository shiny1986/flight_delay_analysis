# ✈️ Flight Delay Prediction & Analysis

Welcome to my first Data Science mini-project! This project is part of my journey into aviation data analytics, combining my passion for skies and my current MSc in Data Science at Aston University.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project uses real-world flight data to:

- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on flight delay trends
- Identify patterns in departure and arrival delays
- Build a simple machine learning model to **predict if a flight will be delayed**

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is a cleaned sample of U.S. domestic flights with the following fields:

- Airline
- Origin & Destination airports
- Distance
- Departure & Arrival Delay (in minutes)
- Cancellation status
- Label: `Delayed` (1 if ArrivalDelay > 15 minutes, else 0)

📂 File: `data/flight_delay_sample.csv`

---

## 🧪 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- pandas, NumPy
- seaborn & matplotlib (for visualization)
- scikit-learn (for ML)

---

## 🔍 Key Questions Explored

- Which airlines and routes are most prone to delays?
- Is there a link between flight distance and delay?
- Can we predict whether a flight will be delayed based on its features?

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Model

A basic model (e.g., logistic regression or random forest) is trained on flight features to predict delay status. Performance is evaluated using:

- Accuracy
- Confusion matrix

---

## 📊 Future Enhancements

- Include weather data as a feature
- Add advanced models (e.g., XGBoost)
- Convert this into a dashboard using Streamlit or Plotly
